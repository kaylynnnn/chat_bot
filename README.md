# Another chat bot.
So, there's not much to put here.  
This bot is another general purpose bot made out of boredom by kal.

# Setup instructions
Okay so apparently you want to set this up for yourself, here are a few steps.

Python 3.10 is required, and you need a PostgreSQL instance.

Steps:
- Setup your venv (python3.10 -m venv venv) and enter it (source venv/bin/activate)
- Install all dependencies (pip install -r requirements.txt)
- Create your config and fill out values (cp config.example.toml config.toml)
- Run the bot. (python run.py)
- Profit?
